# CI-driven scan Action

You can use this Action to integrate vulnerability scans into your CI/CD pipeline in two different ways:
* CI-driven scans - You need an installation of Burp Suite Enterprise Edition for this option. You can view the results of your scans in your CI/CD platform, or in the Burp Suite Enterprise Edition dashboard. For more information, see [CI-driven scans](./ci-driven-scans-with-no-dashboard.md).
* CI-driven scans with no dashboard - You don't need an installation of Burp Suite Enterprise Edition for this option. You can view the results of your scan in your CI/CD platform. For more information, see [CI-driven scans with no dashboard](./ci-driven-scans-with-no-dashboard.md).
